/**
 * Keeps a form's values in localStorage so a sign-out, reload or closed tab cannot lose them.
 *
 * A draft found at mount is offered for restore rather than applied, so an edit form never
 * silently overwrites what the API returned. Saving starts immediately either way: the offer is
 * held in memory, so the newest work is always the thing on disk.
 *
 * The key must identify the signed-in user as well as the form, because a browser profile can
 * be shared: without that, the next person to sign in is offered the previous one's draft. Pass
 * a null key to store nothing, which is what callers should do while the user is unknown.
